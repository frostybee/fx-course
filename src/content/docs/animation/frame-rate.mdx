## What is Frame Rate?

**Frame Rate** refers to the number of frames displayed per second (FPS) in an animation or video. Higher frame rates result in smoother motion, while lower frame rates can lead to choppy animations. Common frame rates include:

- **30 FPS**: Standard for television.
- **60 FPS**: Standard for gaming and smooth animations.
- **24 FPS**: Common in film.
