## Exporting Canvas Drawing to a PNG File

In JavaFX, if you are working with a `Canvas` and you want to export the drawing on that canvas into a **PNG file**, you can do so by converting the content of the `Canvas` to a `WritableImage` and then writing that image to a file. Here's how you can do it:

:::note
## Steps:
1. Add the `javafx.swing` module to the list of modules in the `javafx` section of your `build.gradle` file. The list of modules should be:   
    `modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics',  'javafx.media', 'javafx.swing' ]`
2. Create a `WritableImage` that is the same size as the canvas.
3. Use the `Canvas`'s `snapshot` method to render its contents to the `WritableImage`.
4. Use `ImageIO` to save the `WritableImage` to a PNG file.
:::

## Code Example:

The following code will allow you to save any drawing made on the canvas to a PNG file. It uses the `FileChooser` class to allow the user to select the location where the image file should be saved.

:::tip
- Ensure you have the necessary imports for handling both JavaFX and AWT (specifically `javafx.embed.swing.SwingFXUtils` and `ImageIO`).
- You can adjust the file name and path as needed.
:::

### Running the Code:
When you run the application, you can **click anywhere** on the canvas to trigger the export. It will save the content of the canvas to a file named `canvasDrawing.png` in the directory the user selected.

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.stage.FileChooser;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.canvas.Canvas;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // Create a canvas and get its graphics context
        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(400, 400);
        GraphicsContext gc = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();

        // Draw something on the canvas (example: a red circle)
        gc.setFill(Color.RED);
        gc.fillOval(100, 100, 200, 200);

        // When clicked, export the canvas to a PNG file via the file chooser
        canvas.setOnMouseClicked(event -> exportCanvasToPng(primaryStage, canvas));

        // Set up the scene and stage
        StackPane root = new StackPane();
        root.getChildren().add(canvas);
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 400, 400);
        primaryStage.setTitle("Canvas to PNG Example");
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
    }

## Notes:

1. **Canvas**: A `Canvas` is used to perform drawing. In this example, we draw a red circle, but you can replace this with whatever content you want to draw on the canvas.
   
2. **snapshot()**: This method of the `Canvas` is used to capture its current visual state into a `WritableImage`. The `snapshot` method renders the canvas content into a `WritableImage`, which can be further processed or saved as an image file.

3. **WritableImage**: A `WritableImage` is an image buffer into which the canvas content is copied. It holds pixel data that can be converted into other formats like `BufferedImage`.

4. **SwingFXUtils.fromFXImage()**: This utility method converts a `WritableImage` (JavaFX image) into a `BufferedImage` (Java AWT image), which is compatible with the `ImageIO.write()` method for saving the image.

5. **ImageIO.write()**: This method from the `javax.imageio` package writes the `BufferedImage` to a file in PNG format.
