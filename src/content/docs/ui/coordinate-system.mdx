In JavaFX, the coordinate system is crucial for positioning, transforming, and rendering graphical elements. The JavaFX coordinate system is primarily based on a **2D Cartesian plane**, where each point has an \(x\)-coordinate and a \(y\)-coordinate. Understanding this system helps in managing layouts, positioning nodes, and performing geometric transformations.

### 1. **Basics of the Coordinate System**
In JavaFX, the top-left corner of the scene or node's coordinate space is the origin \((0, 0)\), and the coordinates increase as you move right (positive \(x\)) and down (positive \(y\)). This convention is known as a **top-left coordinate system** and is different from the standard mathematical Cartesian system where the \(y\)-axis increases upwards.

- **X-axis**: Horizontal axis; increases from left to right.
- **Y-axis**: Vertical axis; increases from top to bottom.

For example, a point at coordinates (50, 100) represents a position 50 units to the right of the origin and 100 units down.
