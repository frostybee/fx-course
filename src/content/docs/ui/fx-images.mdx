JavaFX provides a rich set of tools for creating graphical user interfaces, and working with images is a common task when developing desktop applications. Whether you want to display images in your user interface, process them, or animate them, JavaFX offers several classes and APIs to achieve this.

This guide covers how to work with images in JavaFX, starting with the basics and moving through more advanced topics such as image processing and animation.

:::tip
- Working with images in JavaFX is straightforward once you understand how to load, display, and manipulate them. By leveraging `Image` and `ImageView`, combined with advanced features like pixel manipulation and animations, you can create rich and interactive visual applications.

- With `getClass().getResource()`, you can reliably load images from your project resources without worrying about **absolute file paths**, making your code more portable and maintainable.

## Handling Different Image Formats
:::note
JavaFX supports a variety of image formats, including:
- **JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF**

You can load and display any of these formats using the `Image` class, as shown blew. Make sure the **file path** or URL points to a **valid image format**.

## Loading and Displaying Images

### Loading Images with `Image`

To load an image, you use the `Image` class from the `javafx.scene.image` package. This class allows you to load an image from a file, URL, or input stream.

When loading resources from your project (for example, an image in your `resources` folder), it's more robust and portable to use `getClass().getResource()` rather than hardcoding file paths.

Here's how you can load an image from the resources folder:

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.image.Image;
import javafx.scene.image.ImageView;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class ImageExample extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // Load an image from the resources folder using getClass().getResource()
        Image image = new Image(getClass().getResource("/images/invader.png").toExternalForm());

        // Create an ImageView to display the image
        ImageView imageView = new ImageView(image);
        
        // Set the size of the image
        imageView.setFitWidth(300);
        imageView.setFitHeight(200);
        
        // Create a scene and add the ImageView
        Scene scene = new Scene(imageView);
        
        primaryStage.setTitle("JavaFX Image Example");
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

- **Resource Path**: The image is located in the `/images` folder within your `resources` directory. `getClass().getResource("/images/invader.png")` loads the image as a resource, and `.toExternalForm()` converts it into a URL format that the `Image` class can handle.
  
If the image is in the same package as your class, you can load it like this:
```java
Image image = new Image(getClass().getResource("invader.png").toExternalForm());
```

### Displaying Images with `ImageView`

Once you have an `Image` object, you can display it in your JavaFX application using an `ImageView`. The `ImageView` is a special `Node` that can display images within a scene.

You can modify properties like the width, height, or opacity of the image using the `ImageView` object.

```java
imageView.setFitWidth(200);  // Resize the width of the image
imageView.setFitHeight(100); // Resize the height of the image
imageView.setPreserveRatio(true);  // Preserve the aspect ratio of the image
```

## Manipulating Images

### Resizing Images

The `ImageView` provides methods like `setFitWidth()` and `setFitHeight()` to control the size of an image. If you want to preserve the aspect ratio when resizing, use `setPreserveRatio(true)`.

Example:
```java
imageView.setFitWidth(300);
imageView.setFitHeight(200);
imageView.setPreserveRatio(true);  // Ensures the aspect ratio is maintained
```

### Cropping Images

To crop an image, you can create a `Region` that clips the image. JavaFX doesn't provide a direct API to crop images, but you can work around this by using a `Clip` or manipulating the image pixels directly.

Example:
```java
Rectangle clip = new Rectangle(50, 50, 100, 100);  // Clip to a specific region
imageView.setClip(clip);
```

This code will clip the `ImageView` to a rectangle starting at (50, 50) and having a width and height of 100 pixels.

### Adjusting Image Transparency

JavaFX allows you to adjust the opacity of an image using the `ImageView` object’s `setOpacity()` method.

```java
imageView.setOpacity(0.5); // Make the image semi-transparent
```

Values range from `0.0` (completely transparent) to `1.0` (completely opaque).

## Image Processing with JavaFX

### Creating Image Filters

To apply filters (like grayscale, blur, etc.), JavaFX has a `PixelReader` and `PixelWriter` for low-level image manipulation. You can read and write pixel data to manipulate images.

Example of creating a grayscale filter:
```java
Image image = new Image(getClass().getResource("/images/example.jpg").toExternalForm());
WritableImage writableImage = new WritableImage((int) image.getWidth(), (int) image.getHeight());
PixelReader pixelReader = image.getPixelReader();
PixelWriter pixelWriter = writableImage.getPixelWriter();

for (int y = 0; y < image.getHeight(); y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < image.getWidth(); x++) {
        Color color = pixelReader.getColor(x, y);
        double gray = color.getRed() * 0.2989 + color.getGreen() * 0.5870 + color.getBlue() * 0.1140;
        Color grayColor = new Color(gray, gray, gray, color.getOpacity());
        pixelWriter.setColor(x, y, grayColor);
    }
}

// Display the processed image
ImageView imageView = new ImageView(writableImage);
```

This code converts an image to grayscale by calculating the luminance of each pixel.

### Image Manipulation (Pixel Access)

For more advanced image processing, you can access individual pixels using `PixelReader` and manipulate them directly.

```java
PixelReader reader = image.getPixelReader();
Color color = reader.getColor(10, 10);  // Get the color of the pixel at (10, 10)
```

This allows you to create custom filters or transformations based on pixel values.

## Animating Images

### Simple Image Transitions

You can animate images using the `TranslateTransition`, `FadeTransition`, or other transition classes in JavaFX.

For example, fading an image in:

```java
FadeTransition fadeTransition = new FadeTransition(Duration.seconds(2), imageView);
fadeTransition.setFromValue(0.0);
fadeTransition.setToValue(1.0);
fadeTransition.play();
```

### Animation with `ImageView` and `KeyFrame`

To animate an image (e.g., moving an image), use `Timeline` with `KeyFrame`:

```java
Timeline timeline = new Timeline(
    new KeyFrame(Duration.ZERO, new KeyValue(imageView.translateXProperty(), 0)),
    new KeyFrame(Duration.seconds(5), new KeyValue(imageView.translateXProperty(), 500))
);
timeline.play();
```

This animates the `ImageView`'s `translateX` property over 5 seconds.

## Saving Images

JavaFX doesn’t provide a direct API for saving images, but you can use `PixelReader` and `PixelWriter` to manually save images by reading pixel data and writing it to an output stream.

Alternatively, for simple saving, you can use the `BufferedImage` class (from `javax.imageio.ImageIO`) to save an image:

```java
Buffered

Image bufferedImage = SwingFXUtils.fromFXImage(image, null);
ImageIO.write(bufferedImage, "png", new File("output.png"));
```

This requires converting the JavaFX `Image` to a `BufferedImage` and then saving it with `ImageIO`.
